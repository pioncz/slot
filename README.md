Simple slot game example. There are 5 reels on the screen, once player clicks on "Play!", they start to spin. Reels are animating with a backout easing effect.   

Made with PIXI.js

## Todo

Create win / loose / error states  
Implement backend connection and ability to set final symbols - win/loose steered by backend, not frontend  
Accessibility: make the game playable vie the keyboard
